## 🎯 Next Steps: Create GitHub Repository

### Step 1: Create New Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. **Click "New Repository"** (green button or "+" icon)
3. **Repository Settings**:
   - **Repository Name**: `AI-Multi-Service-Platform`
   - **Description**: `🚀 Complete documentation for AI Multi-Service Platform - A zero-budget student startup providing unlimited free-tier AI access. Includes PRD, technical architecture, funding strategy, team structure & 24-week implementation roadmap to ₹5L+/month revenue.`
   - **Visibility**: ✅ **Public** (very important!)
   - **Initialize**: ❌ **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
   - **Initialize**: ❌ **DO NOT** add .gitignore or license
4. **Click "Create Repository"**

### Step 2: Copy Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. **Copy the HTTPS URL** that looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Multi-Service-Platform.git
```

### Step 3: Add Remote Origin and Push

Run these commands in your terminal (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username):

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Multi-Service-Platform.git

# Rename the default branch to main (GitHub standard)
git branch -M main

# Push all files to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
